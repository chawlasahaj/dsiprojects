The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html) has acknowledged it as the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. However, there are no vaccines to prevent or medications to treat WNV in people -- according to the CDC, 1 in 5 people who are infected develop a fever and other symptoms, while 1 out of 150 infected people develop a serious, sometimes fatal, illness.\n\nIn Illinois, [West Nile virus was first identified in September 2001](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/west-nile-virus) when laboratory tests confirmed its presence in two dead crows found in the Chicago area. The following year, the state's first human cases and deaths from West Nile disease were recorded and all but two of the state's 102 counties eventually reported a positive human, bird, mosquito or horse. By the end of 2002, Illinois had counted more human cases (884) and deaths (64) than any other state in the United States.\n\nSince then, Illinois and more specifically Chicago, has continued to suffer from multiple outbreaks of the West Nile Virus. From 2005 to 2016, a total of 1,371 human WNV cases were [reported](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227160) within Illinois. Out of these total reported cases, 906 cases (66%) were from the Chicago region (Cook and DuPage Counties). \n\nWith this in mind, <b>our project is aimed at predicting outbreaks of the West Nile Virus</b>. This will help the City of Chicago and Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) more efficiently and effectively allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially deadly virus. Specifically, our model will use a combination of weather, time and location features to predict the presence of WNV within mosquito traps set up throughout Chicago.

They can collect aerial images that can be used analyzed to identify and map breeding sites—such as cisterns, pots and buckets, \nold tires and flower pots. These images can be aggregated into accurate maps to support targeted application of larvicides \n(insecticides that specifically target the larval stage of an insect) at these potential breeding sites.\n2. Once larval habitats are identified, drones can be equipped to carry and apply larvicides and/or adulticides to small targeted areas. \nThese drones can also be fitted with a global positioning system (GPS) that can track flight patterns in conjunction with insecticide application. \nAn operator can remotely pilot the drone or, in some cases, autopilot programs may be available for pre-programmed flights. Drones can be \nuseful to target specific areas with larvicides or adulticides, as an alternative to truck-mounted applications that may require a \nhigh degree of drift of droplets in order to reach a target area in remote locations. These drones can spray potentially up to 80 acres in a day's work.\n\nIn summary, drones could be more environmentally friendly than doing the same spraying procedure on foot, and are likely to be a lot more accurate due to the ability \nto spray from a fully-vertical angle.\n\n<b>Adoption of best practices</b>\n\nThe city of Chicago can aim to reduce spraying target areas by adopting guidelines from tropical countries like [Singapore](https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/stop-dengue) that have proven to be successfully \nin combatting mosquito-borne viruses. For example, this could involve active on-the-ground checks of homes and premises for mosquito habitats, where public officers \nprovide advice on steps you can take to prevent mosquito breeding and impose penalties if premises are found with mosquito breeding.\n\nThrough automation and more efficient mosquito vector control processes, we can reduce the cost of spraying, \nenabling the city of Chicago to save human lives and prevent further outbreaks of the West Nile Virus.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00008-cdb7ba56-a122-4763-9b2c-78ecfba4182d","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data
